* Version 0.4.1
 - sodium_version_*() functions were not exported in version 0.4. They
are now visible as intended.
 - sodium_init() now calls randombytes_stir().
 - optimized assembly version of salsa20 is now used on amd64.
 - further cleanups and enhanced compatibility with non-C99 compilers.

* Version 0.4
 - Most constants and operations are now available as actual functions
instead of macros, making it easier to use from other languages.
 - New operation: crypto_generichash, featuring a variable key size, a
variable output size, and a streaming API. Currently implemented using
Blake2b.
 - The package can be compiled in a separate directory.
 - aes128ctr functions are exported.
 - Optimized versions of curve25519 (curve25519_donna_c64), poly1305
(poly1305_53) and ed25519 (ed25519_ref10) are available. Optionally calling
sodium_init() once before using the library makes it pick the fastest
implementation.
 - New convenience function: sodium_memzero() in order to securely
wipe a memory area.
 - A whole bunch of cleanups and portability enhancements.
 - On Windows, a .REF file is generated along with the shared library,
for use with Visual Studio. The installation path for these has become
$prefix/bin as expected by MingW.

* Version 0.3
 - The crypto_shorthash operation has been added, implemented using
SipHash-2-4.

* Version 0.2
 - crypto_sign_seed_keypair() has been added

* Version 0.1
 - Initial release.
