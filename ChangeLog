* Version 1.0.3
 - In addition to sodium_bin2hex(), sodium_hex2bin() is now a
constant-time function.
 - crypto_stream_xsalsa20_ic() has been added.
 - crypto_generichash_statebytes(), crypto_auth_*_statebytes() and
crypto_hash_*_statebytes() have been added in order to retrieve the
size of structures keeping states from foreign languages.
 - The JavaScript target doesn't require /dev/urandom or an external
randombytes() implementation any more. Other minor Emscripten-related
improvements have been made in order to support libsodium.js
 - Custom randombytes implementations do not need to provide their own
implementation of randombytes_uniform() any more. randombytes_stir()
and randombytes_close() can also be NULL pointers if they are not
required.
 - On Linux, getrandom(2) is being used instead of directly accessing
/dev/urandom, if the kernel supports this system call.
 - crypto_box_seal() and crypto_box_seal_open() have been added.
 - A solutions for Visual Studio 2015 was added.

* Version 1.0.2
 - The _easy and _detached APIs now support precalculated keys;
crypto_box_easy_afternm(), crypto_box_open_easy_afternm(),
crypto_box_detached_afternm() and crypto_box_open_detached_afternm()
have been added as an alternative to the NaCl interface.
 - Memory allocation functions can now be used on operating systems with
no memory protection.
 - crypto_sign_open() and crypto_sign_edwards25519sha512batch_open()
now accept a NULL pointer instead of a pointer to the message size, if
storing this information is not required.
 - The close-on-exec flag is now set on the descriptor returned when
opening /dev/urandom.
 - A libsodium-uninstalled.pc file to use pkg-config even when
libsodium is not installed, has been added.
 - The iOS target now includes armv7s and arm64 optimized code, as well
as i386 and x86_64 code for the iOS simulator.
 - sodium_free() can now be called on regions with PROT_NONE protection.
 - The Javascript tests can run on Ubuntu, where the node binary was
renamed nodejs. io.js can also be used instead of node.

* Version 1.0.1
 - DLL_EXPORT was renamed SODIUM_DLL_EXPORT in order to avoid
collisions with similar macros defined by other libraries.
 - sodium_bin2hex() is now constant-time.
 - crypto_secretbox_detached() now supports overlapping input and output
regions.
 - NaCl's donna_c64 implementation of curve25519 was reading an extra byte
past the end of the buffer containing the base point. This has been
fixed.

* Version 1.0.0
 - The API and ABI are now stable. New features will be added, but
backward-compatibility is guaranteed through all the 1.x.y releases.
 - crypto_sign() properly works with overlapping regions again. Thanks
to @pysiak for reporting this regression introduced in version 0.6.1.
 - The test suite has been extended.

* Version 0.7.1 (1.0 RC2)
 - This is the second release candidate of Sodium 1.0. Minor
compilation, readability and portability changes have been made and the
test suite was improved, but the API is the same as the previous release
candidate.

* Version 0.7.0 (1.0 RC1)
 - Allocating memory to store sensitive data can now be done using
sodium_malloc() and sodium_allocarray(). These functions add guard
pages around the protected data to make it less likely to be
accessible in a heartbleed-like scenario. In addition, the protection
for memory regions allocated that way can be changed using
sodium_mprotect_noaccess(), sodium_mprotect_readonly() and
sodium_mprotect_readwrite().
 - ed25519 keys can be converted to curve25519 keys with
crypto_sign_ed25519_pk_to_curve25519() and
crypto_sign_ed25519_sk_to_curve25519(). This allows using the same
keys for signature and encryption.
 - The seed and the public key can be extracted from an ed25519 key
using crypto_sign_ed25519_sk_to_seed() and crypto_sign_ed25519_sk_to_pk().
 - aes256 was removed. A timing-attack resistant implementation might
be added later, but not before version 1.0 is tagged.
 - The crypto_pwhash_scryptxsalsa208sha256_* compatibility layer was
removed. Use crypto_pwhash_scryptsalsa208sha256_*.
 - The compatibility layer for implementation-specific functions was
removed.
 - Compilation issues with Mingw64 on MSYS (not MSYS2) were fixed.
 - crypto_pwhash_scryptsalsa208sha256_STRPREFIX was added: it contains
the prefix produced by crypto_pwhash_scryptsalsa208sha256_str()

* Version 0.6.1
 - Important bug fix: when crypto_sign_open() was given a signed
message too short to even contain a signature, it was putting an
unlimited amount of zeros into the target buffer instead of
immediately returning -1. The bug was introduced in version 0.5.0.
 - New API: crypto_sign_detached() and crypto_sign_verify_detached()
to produce and verify ed25519 signatures without having to duplicate
the message.
 - New ./configure switch: --enable-minimal, to create a smaller
library, with only the functions required for the high-level API.
Mainly useful for the JavaScript target and embedded systems.
 - All the symbols are now exported by the Emscripten build script.
 - The pkg-config .pc file is now always installed even if the
pkg-config tool is not available during the installation.

* Version 0.6.0
 - The ChaCha20 stream cipher has been added, as crypto_stream_chacha20_*
 - The ChaCha20Poly1305 AEAD construction has been implemented, as
crypto_aead_chacha20poly1305_*
 - The _easy API does not require any heap allocations any more and
does not have any overhead over the NaCl API. With the password
hashing function being an obvious exception, the library doesn't
allocate and will not allocate heap memory ever.
 - crypto_box and crypto_secretbox have a new _detached API to store
the authentication tag and the encrypted message separately.
 - crypto_pwhash_scryptxsalsa208sha256*() functions have been renamed
crypto_pwhash_scryptsalsa208sha256*().
 - The low-level crypto_pwhash_scryptsalsa208sha256_ll() function
allows setting individual parameters of the scrypt function.
 - New macros and functions for recommended crypto_pwhash_* parameters
have been added.
 - Similarly to crypto_sign_seed_keypair(), crypto_box_seed_keypair()
has been introduced to deterministically generate a key pair from a seed.
 - crypto_onetimeauth() now provides a streaming interface.
 - crypto_stream_chacha20_xor_ic() and crypto_stream_salsa20_xor_ic()
have been added to use a non-zero initial block counter.
 - On Windows, CryptGenRandom() was replaced by RtlGenRandom(), which
doesn't require the Crypt API.
 - The high bit in curve25519 is masked instead of processing the key as
a 256-bit value.
 - The curve25519 ref implementation was replaced by the latest ref10
implementation from Supercop.
 - sodium_mlock() now prevents memory from being included in coredumps
on Linux 3.4+

* Version 0.5.0
 - sodium_mlock()/sodium_munlock() have been introduced to lock pages
in memory before storing sensitive data, and to zero them before
unlocking them.
 - High-level wrappers for crypto_box and crypto_secretbox
(crypto_box_easy and crypto_secretbox_easy) can be used to avoid
dealing with the specific memory layout regular functions depend on.
 - crypto_pwhash_scryptsalsa208sha256* functions have been added
to derive a key from a password, and for password storage.
 - Salsa20 and ed25519 implementations now support overlapping
inputs/keys/outputs (changes imported from supercop-20140505).
 - New build scripts for Visual Studio, Emscripten, different Android
architectures and msys2 are available.
 - The poly1305-53 implementation has been replaced with Floodyberry's
poly1305-donna32 and poly1305-donna64 implementations.
 - sodium_hex2bin() has been added to complement sodium_bin2hex().
 - On OpenBSD and Bitrig, arc4random() is used instead of reading
/dev/urandom.
 - crypto_auth_hmac_sha512() has been implemented.
 - sha256 and sha512 now have a streaming interface.
 - hmacsha256, hmacsha512 and hmacsha512256 now support keys of
arbitrary length, and have a streaming interface.
 - crypto_verify_64() has been implemented.
 - first-class Visual Studio build system, thanks to @evoskuil
 - CPU features are now detected at runtime.

 - The donna_c64 implementation of curve25519_donna_c64 now handles
non-canonical points like the ref implementation
 - Missing scalarmult_curve25519 and stream_salsa20 constants are now exported
 - A crypto_onetimeauth_poly1305_ref() wrapper has been added

* Version 0.4.3

 - pkg-config can now be used in order to retrieve compilations flags for
using libsodium.
 - crypto_stream_aes256estream_*() can now deal with unaligned input
on platforms that require word alignment.

are now visible as intended.
 - sodium_init() now calls randombytes_stir().
 - optimized assembly version of salsa20 is now used on amd64.
 - further cleanups and enhanced compatibility with non-C99 compilers.

* Version 0.4
 - Most constants and operations are now available as actual functions
instead of macros, making it easier to use from other languages.
 - New operation: crypto_generichash, featuring a variable key size, a
variable output size, and a streaming API. Currently implemented using
Blake2b.
 - The package can be compiled in a separate directory.
 - aes128ctr functions are exported.
 - Optimized versions of curve25519 (curve25519_donna_c64), poly1305
(poly1305_53) and ed25519 (ed25519_ref10) are available. Optionally calling
sodium_init() once before using the library makes it pick the fastest
implementation.
 - New convenience function: sodium_memzero() in order to securely
wipe a memory area.
 - A whole bunch of cleanups and portability enhancements.
 - On Windows, a .REF file is generated along with the shared library,
for use with Visual Studio. The installation path for these has become
$prefix/bin as expected by MingW.
