* Version 0.4.5
 - Restore compatibility with OSX <= 10.6

* Version 0.4.4
 - Visual Studio is officially supported (VC 2010 & VC 2013)
 - mingw64 is now supported
 - big-endian architectures are now supported as well
 - The donna_c64 implementation of curve25519_donna_c64 now handles
non-canonical points like the ref implementation
 - Missing scalarmult_curve25519 and stream_salsa20 constants are now exported
 - A crypto_onetimeauth_poly1305_ref() wrapper has been added

* Version 0.4.3
 - crypto_sign_seedbytes() and crypto_sign_SEEDBYTES were added.
 - crypto_onetimeauth_poly1305_implementation_name() was added.
 - poly1305-ref has been replaced by a faster implementation,
Floodyberry's poly1305-donna-unrolled.
 - Stackmarkings have been added to assembly code, for Hardened Gentoo.
 - pkg-config can now be used in order to retrieve compilations flags for
using libsodium.
 - crypto_stream_aes256estream_*() can now deal with unaligned input
on platforms that require word alignment.
 - portability improvements.

* Version 0.4.2
 - All NaCl constants are now also exposed as functions.
 - The Android and iOS cross-compilation script have been improved.
 - libsodium can now be cross-compiled to Windows from Linux.
 - libsodium can now be compiled with emscripten.
 - New convenience function (prototyped in utils.h): sodium_bin2hex().

* Version 0.4.1
 - sodium_version_*() functions were not exported in version 0.4. They
are now visible as intended.
 - sodium_init() now calls randombytes_stir().
 - optimized assembly version of salsa20 is now used on amd64.
 - further cleanups and enhanced compatibility with non-C99 compilers.

* Version 0.4
 - Most constants and operations are now available as actual functions
instead of macros, making it easier to use from other languages.
 - New operation: crypto_generichash, featuring a variable key size, a
variable output size, and a streaming API. Currently implemented using
Blake2b.
 - The package can be compiled in a separate directory.
 - aes128ctr functions are exported.
 - Optimized versions of curve25519 (curve25519_donna_c64), poly1305
(poly1305_53) and ed25519 (ed25519_ref10) are available. Optionally calling
sodium_init() once before using the library makes it pick the fastest
implementation.
 - New convenience function: sodium_memzero() in order to securely
wipe a memory area.
 - A whole bunch of cleanups and portability enhancements.
 - On Windows, a .REF file is generated along with the shared library,
for use with Visual Studio. The installation path for these has become
$prefix/bin as expected by MingW.

* Version 0.3
 - The crypto_shorthash operation has been added, implemented using
SipHash-2-4.

* Version 0.2
 - crypto_sign_seed_keypair() has been added

* Version 0.1
 - Initial release.
