The .dirs files that duplicate .install files seem to be required to build the
package in some circumstances, including Launchpad build servers.

I have not tackled big items which I don't understand, such as removing .la file
 and introducing multiarch (which depends on the former).
If you can do any of those things, you're very welcome.
