============

Sodium is a new, easy-to-use software library for encryption,
decryption, signatures, password hashing and more.

It is a portable, cross-compilable, installable, packageable
fork of [NaCl](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/), with a compatible API, and an
extended API to improve usability even further.

Its goal is to provide all of the core operations needed to build
higher-level cryptographic tools.

Sodium supports a variety of compilers and operating systems,
including Windows (with MingW or Visual Studio, x86 and x64), iOS, Android,
as well as Javascript and Webassembly.
