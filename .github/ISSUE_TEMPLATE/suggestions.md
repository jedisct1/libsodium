Hey there! Got an idea for libsodium?

This template is for tracking work that's already been planned. For new feature suggestions, here's the best path forward:

1. Check the [roadmap](https://doc.libsodium.org/roadmap) to see if it's already on our radar
2. Start an "Ideas" thread in [Discussions](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/discussions)

From there, we can chat about it and decide together if it should become a planned change. This helps keep the issue tracker focused on active work.
