Thanks for taking the time to report a bug!

This tracker is for confirmed, reproducible bugs. If you're looking for help with installation, configuration, usage, or issues with third-party packages, the [Discussions](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/discussions) section is a better place to start.

### Before you file

- Try reproducing the issue with the current `libsodium-stable` package, installed as documented at https://doc.libsodium.org/installation
- If the bug isn't obvious, please describe all the steps needed to reproduce it on a fresh install of macOS, Windows, OpenBSD, or Ubuntu Linux

### Not sure if it's a bug?

No worries! Feel free to [start a discussion](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/discussions) first and we can figure it out together.
